# LeafWise - Future Features & Enhancements

This document outlines potential future features and improvements for the LeafWise application beyond its current UI prototype stage.

## Core Functionality Enhancements

1.  **Full Backend Implementation**:
    *   Develop a robust backend server (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask).
    *   Integrate a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore).
    *   Implement secure, JWT-based user authentication with password hashing, refresh tokens, etc.
    *   Move all data storage (user profiles, plant data, care tasks) to the backend database.
    *   Implement API endpoints for all CRUD operations.

2.  **Cloud Image Storage**:
    *   Integrate a cloud storage solution (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Firebase Storage) for all user-uploaded images (plant photos, avatars). Images should be uploaded securely to the cloud, and only their URLs stored in the database.

3.  **Advanced Care Plan Management**:
    *   **Customizable Schedules**: Allow users to fully customize the frequency, specific dates, and times for each care task beyond AI suggestions.
    *   **Task Completion Tracking**: Implement a system for users to mark tasks as complete.
        *   Maintain a history of completed tasks.
        *   Automatically reschedule the next occurrence based on completion.
    *   **Snooze/Reschedule Tasks**: Allow users to snooze or easily reschedule individual task occurrences.

4.  **Robust Push Notification System**:
    *   Implement server-driven push notifications (e.g., using Firebase Cloud Messaging or similar) for:
        *   Care task reminders.
        *   Warnings based on AI analysis (e.g., "Your plant might need attention").
    *   User-configurable notification preferences.

5.  **Enhanced AI Capabilities**:
    *   **Pest & Disease Library Integration**: Link AI diagnosis to a visual library of common plant pests and diseases.
    *   **Watering Needs Prediction**: More advanced AI to predict watering needs based on plant type, pot size, local weather data (if user shares location), and past watering history.
    *   **Light Meter Integration (Conceptual)**: Explore using device sensors (if feasible and permitted) to estimate light conditions.
    *   **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune AI models on specific plant datasets for improved accuracy in identification and diagnosis.
    *   **AI Chatbot for Plant Care**: An interactive chatbot for users to ask plant care questions.

## User Experience & Interface

1.  **Community Features (Optional)**:
    *   Allow users to share plant progress or ask for advice (requires significant backend and moderation).
2.  **Detailed Plant Species Database**:
    *   Integrate or build a comprehensive database of plant species with detailed care information, which the AI can reference or users can browse.
3.  **Gamification**:
    *   Badges, streaks, or points for consistent plant care.
4.  **Advanced Search & Filtering**:
    *   More granular filtering options (e.g., by watering needs, light preference).
5.  **Accessibility Audit & Improvements**:
    *   Conduct a full accessibility audit and implement improvements (WCAG compliance).
6.  **UI Theme Customization**:
    *   Allow users to choose from a few different color themes.

## Technical & Operational

1.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Unit tests for components and utility functions.
    *   Integration tests for AI flows and key user workflows.
    *   End-to-end tests (e.g., using Cypress or Playwright).
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    *   Automate building, testing, and deployment (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Vercel, AWS CodePipeline).
3.  **Analytics & Monitoring**:
    *   Integrate analytics to understand feature usage.
    *   Set up monitoring and error tracking for the production application.
4.  **Data Backup & Recovery**:
    *   Implement robust backup and recovery strategies for backend data.
5.  **Scalability Planning**:
    *   Design backend and database for scalability as user base grows.

# LeafWise - Future Features & Enhancements

This document outlines potential future features and improvements for the LeafWise application, building upon its current UI prototype stage and existing AWS Amplify backend.

## Core Functionality Enhancements

1.  **Full Backend Implementation**:
    *   **Expand Existing AWS Amplify Backend**: Leverage and extend the current AWS Amplify backend for more complex data models, advanced business logic, and integrations.
    *   **Advanced APIs & Custom Logic**: Implement custom backend logic (e.g., using AWS Lambda functions) for features that go beyond standard GraphQL operations provided by Amplify Data.
    *   Implement secure, JWT-based user authentication with password hashing, refresh tokens, etc.
    *   **Integrate with External Services**: Connect the backend to third-party APIs for enhanced functionality (e.g., advanced weather data, plant-specific knowledge bases).
    *   **Refine Data Models**: Optimize and potentially denormalize data models within Amplify Data for performance and specific query patterns.

2.  **Cloud Image Storage**:
    *   **Enhance AWS Amplify Storage Usage**: Further optimize image storage and retrieval from Amazon S3 (already in use via Amplify Storage). This could include advanced resizing, content delivery network (CDN) integration, or more granular access controls.

3.  **Advanced Care Plan Management**:
    *   **Customizable Schedules**: Allow users to fully customize the frequency, specific dates, and times for each care task beyond AI suggestions.
    *   **Task Completion Tracking**: Implement a system for users to mark tasks as complete.
        *   Maintain a history of completed tasks.
        *   Automatically reschedule the next occurrence based on completion.
    *   **Snooze/Reschedule Tasks**: Allow users to snooze or easily reschedule individual task occurrences.

4.  **Robust Push Notification System**:
    *   Implement server-driven push notifications (e.g., using Firebase Cloud Messaging or similar) for:
        *   Care task reminders.
        *   Warnings based on AI analysis (e.g., "Your plant might need attention").
    *   User-configurable notification preferences.

5.  **Enhanced AI Capabilities**:
    *   **Pest & Disease Library Integration**: Link AI diagnosis to a visual library of common plant pests and diseases.
    *   **Watering Needs Prediction**: More advanced AI to predict watering needs based on plant type, pot size, local weather data (if user shares location), and past watering history.
    *   **Light Meter Integration (Conceptual)**: Explore using device sensors (if feasible and permitted) to estimate light conditions.
    *   **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune AI models on specific plant datasets for improved accuracy in identification and diagnosis.
    *   **AI Chatbot for Plant Care**: An interactive chatbot for users to ask plant care questions.

## User Experience & Interface

1.  **Community Features (Optional)**:
    *   Allow users to share plant progress or ask for advice (requires significant backend and moderation).
2.  **Detailed Plant Species Database**:
    *   Integrate or build a comprehensive database of plant species with detailed care information, which the AI can reference or users can browse.
3.  **Gamification**:
    *   Badges, streaks, or points for consistent plant care.
4.  **Advanced Search & Filtering**:
    *   More granular filtering options (e.g., by watering needs, light preference).
5.  **Accessibility Audit & Improvements**:
    *   Conduct a full accessibility audit and implement improvements (WCAG compliance).
6.  **UI Theme Customization**:
    *   Allow users to choose from a few different color themes.

## Technical & Operational

1.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Unit tests for components and utility functions.
    *   Integration tests for AI flows and key user workflows.
    *   End-to-end tests (e.g., using Cypress or Playwright).
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    *   Automate building, testing, and deployment (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Vercel, AWS CodePipeline).
3.  **Analytics & Monitoring**:
    *   Integrate analytics to understand feature usage.
    *   Set up monitoring and error tracking for the production application.
4.  **Data Backup & Recovery**:
    *   Implement robust backup and recovery strategies for backend data.
5.  **Scalability Planning**:
    *   Design backend and database for scalability as user base grows.
